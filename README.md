Master branch is not uder active development, since I will be focusing more on new, more material designish, version.
Originally there was a structured order to everything in these files, but after weeks and weeks of nitpicks and alterations things have gotten pretty ugly.

This theme is(or will be) heavily influenced by Material Design from Google. I'm doing my best to be as precise to MD guide, as possible.
