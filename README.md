This theme is(or will be) heavily influenced by Material Design from Google.
Although, it's still in development process thus I don't recommend to use this on production.

Please, keep in mind, that this theme has government based principles and there will be a lot different tweaks for our needs - but they can be easily deleted afterwards.
